## üîß Debug Commands

### Check Profile in Console
```typescript
import useProfileStore from '@/session/stores/useProfileStore';
console.log(useProfileStore.getState().profile);
```

### Manually Update Balance
```typescript
import { updateProfileBalances } from '@/services/profileService';
updateProfileBalances(1000, 50); // Give 1000 money, 50 tokens
```

### Force Sync to Firestore
```typescript
import { writeProfileToFirestore } from '@/session/sync/profileSync';
import { useAuth } from '@/context/AuthContext';
const { user } = useAuth();
if (user) writeProfileToFirestore(user.uid);
```

### Reset Profile (Testing Only)
```typescript
import useProfileStore from '@/session/stores/useProfileStore';
import mmkvStorage from '@/session/storage/mmkvStorage';

// Clear store
useProfileStore.getState().clearProfile();

// Clear local storage
mmkvStorage.removeItem('profile-store');

// Log out and back in to recreate
```

### Check Firestore Data
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Find collection: `users`
4. Find document: Your UID
5. Check `profile` object

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: Profile shows "anonymous" and 0 values
**Causes**:
- Not logged in
- Profile not initialized
- Sync failed

**Fix**:
1. Check auth state: `useAuth().isAuthenticated`
2. Check profile in store: `useProfileStore.getState().profile`
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify Firestore rules allow access

### Issue: Rewards not appearing
**Causes**:
- `finish()` not called
- Profile is null
- Import error

**Fix**:
1. Add logs in `finish()` method
2. Verify profile exists before awarding
3. Check console for errors
4. Manually call `awardReward()` to test

### Issue: Profile not syncing between devices
**Causes**:
- Not logged in with same account
- Network issues
- Firestore rules block access

**Fix**:
1. Verify same UID on both devices
2. Check network connection
3. Check Firestore rules
4. Look for "Profile snapshot error" logs

### Issue: UI not updating after profile change
**Causes**:
- Not using Zustand selector
- Using `getState()` instead of hook
- Component not re-rendering

**Fix**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong - not reactive
const profile = useProfileStore.getState().profile;

// ‚úÖ Correct - reactive
const profile = useProfileStore((s) => s.profile);
```
